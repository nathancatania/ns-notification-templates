Message:
```
A phishing attack is when a scammer tries to trick you into revealing your password, and they will do so by tricking you into entering it into a login page that looks legitimate, but actually isn't.

This website has been detected as one of these fraudulant pages, and so the company system has blocked access to protect you.

You will only ever be asked to enter your company password by Microsoft at the website https://login.microsoftonline.com. You should NEVER sign-up for services using your corporate email without obtaining permission from IT. This is to ensure that the data that our company holds is kept safe.

If you are ever in doubt, please raise a ticket with Helpdesk and they will assist you.
